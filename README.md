# jbcnconf-2017-health-care
Health Care Demo for JBCN Conf 2017

##Â Goals and Motivations
This repository contains a simple example using the following frameworks:
- Spring Cloud Data Flow
- Spring Cloud Bus
- Spring Boot
- Eureka (and Feign)
- Activiti Process Engine

This example is intended to show how we can improve communication and collaboration with Domain Experts that can express their Domain Knowledge using different types of Models. These microservices show how we can mix and match the tools that we have available, to make sure that we use the best tool for the job at hand. 

## Services

* Patient Record Service: just a Patient Repository
* Emergency Source: Endpoint in charge of receiving Emergency Notifications, it will dispatch the notification using the message bus, so it can be processed asap.
* Emergency Enricher: Processor in charge of decorating the initial emergency report with more information. This Processor uses other services such as the Patient Record Service to decorate the emergency information with extra data if the Patient is known by the organization. This service process the emergency and send via a message the decorated Emergency.
* Emergency Dispatcher: This service is in charge of deciding how to deal with a specific Emergency. This service will have the domain expertise to know which of the available procedures should be used to deal with an Emergency based on the Emergency available information.
* Emergency Procedure X: these services represent different types of procedures for different types of emergencies.
* Procedure Registry: this service encapsulate an instance of Eureka that is used to register each of our procedures and their metadata
* Emergency Audit: this service is in charge of collecting all the business infomration generated by the services, that can be used to visualize what is going on in real time and to make sure that everything is tracked for legal purposes. 



* We show a Domain model: Patient, Observation, Procedure, Emergency 
	* project: model (it will be great if we can use FHIR as our model, it is not very DDD like)
* We show a business model (quickly describe it and show its value)
	* Simple decision: that defines how to categorise Patients (high risk/low risk)
	* Simple process: that defines how to treat incoming emergencies
	* Both business models emit events
* We show a couple of services:
	* Emergency Service
		* project: emergency-service
		* dependencies: activiti-engine
	* Patient Medical Records Service
		* project: patient-records-service
		* dependencies: pure crud
* We show a Front End just to have a way to interact, this will require
	* API Gateway
	* Spring Message Bus
	* Spring Data Flow 
		* We need to create sources/processors/sinks
*  Approach 1: Emergency Service will use the models by having embedded engines	 
* (Approach 2: Incoming Emergency Service will use generated code)
* (Optional) We show some kind of Business Value driven monitoring (should we use KIBANA??? ) 



# Requirements

We are using Spring Data Flow to connect Sources, Processors and Sinks together via Streams
We are also using Docker compose in order to start some providers such as RabbitMQ and Redis

### Start Docker Compose
cd docker/
docker-compose up -d


### Download Spring Data Flow
curl -O http://repo.spring.io/snapshot/org/springframework/cloud/spring-cloud-dataflow-server-local/1.2.2.BUILD-SNAPSHOT/spring-cloud-dataflow-server-local-1.2.2.BUILD-20170601.204606-1.jar
java -jar spring-cloud-dataflow-server-local-1.2.2.BUILD-20170601.204606-1.jar
### Start the Server
java -jar spring-cloud-dataflow-server-local-1.2.1.RELEASE.jar

### Download and start the Data flow shell
curl -O http://repo.spring.io/snapshot/org/springframework/cloud/spring-cloud-dataflow-shell/1.2.2.BUILD-SNAPSHOT/spring-cloud-dataflow-shell-1.2.2.BUILD-20170601.204606-1.jar
java -jar spring-cloud-dataflow-shell-1.2.2.BUILD-20170601.204606-1.jar

### Flo -> UI
If the Data Flow server is started you can access to the UI by pointing the Browser to: http://localhost:9393/dashboad

### Registering Apps and configuring & deploying the stream definition

app register --name time-source --type source --uri maven://com.example:emergency-source:jar:0.0.1-SNAPSHOT

app register --name time-processor --type processor --uri maven://com.example:emergency-processor:jar:0.0.1-SNAPSHOT

app register --name logging-sink --type sink --uri maven://com.example:emergency-sink:jar:0.0.1-SNAPSHOT

stream create --name time-to-log --definition 'time-source | time-processor | logging-sink'

stream deploy --name time-to-log


### Creating a new emergency
The Emergency Source project expose a REST endpoint where you can send new Emergencies. 
These emergencies will be propageted to the Emergency Processor which will start a Process for each of these emergencies. 
All the events emited by the Processor will be sent to the Emergency Sink.

In order to create a new emergency you need to look at the Emergency Source deployed app in the Dashboard:  http://localhost:9393/dashboad
and send a POST request to http://localhost:<look for the assigned port>/api/emergency/
With the following body: 

 {
	"date": "1496648974639",
	"location": {
		"longitude": 2.0,
		"latitude": 1.0
	}
 }

Alternatively, you can use the Chrome (extension) POSTman collection that you can found in root directory. Notice that you will need to modify the ports.
